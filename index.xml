      <description>The Commodore 64 was my first computer, and I became a computer engineer because of it.
Today, 40 years after its release, many developers are producing software for this amazing machine.
To kill time, I started reading an old book &amp;ldquo;Creating Arcade Games On The Commodore 64&amp;rdquo; written by Robert Camp and published in 1984.
The book contains many code examples, and when I booted up my c64 to copy this code (as I did when I was a teenager) I realized: I have lost the conveniences of newer editors.</description>

      <description>I like experimenting, studying new things, reading, photography, drawing relaxes me. Computer science is my greatest passion and my job: this is not always a good thing.</description>
